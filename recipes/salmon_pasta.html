        <h2>Salmon Pasta Recipe</h2>
        <p>This smoked salmon pasta is a lighter version of pasta carbonara. For people who want the flavor but not the bacon, smoked salmon is the perfect substitute!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>half an onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups skim milk</li>
            <li>half a cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen green peas, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>half a cup canned mushrooms, drained</li>
            <li>10 ounces smoked salmon, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
